**Overview of SHINE:** *SHINE jointly optimizes the objectives of end-to-end subgraph classification and hypergraph nodes' similarity regularization. SHINE simultaneously learns representations for both nodes and hyperedges using strongly dual attention message passing. The learned representations are aggregated via a subgraph attention layer and used to train a multilayer perceptron for inductive subgraph inferencing. *
